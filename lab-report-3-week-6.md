Below is my /ssh/config file. I edited it via the VScode terminal by typing in the commands `touch ~/.ssh/config` to create the file on my local computer and `open ~/.ssh/config` to open and edit it. I put the necessary contents in the file.

Below is an example of using the scp command to copy my `test-file.md` from my local computer to my ieng6 account, using the ssh command with my alias `ieng6` to log into my ieng6 account and finally using `ls` to make sure that the file was copied correctly.
