# Lab 1

This Lab will attempt to help someone navigate through some of the terminal commands mainly those which allow remote access to a server from a client's server using the ssh and the scp commands.


## step 1:
Firstly, we would need to install the software that will be installing Visual Studio which can be accessed using this link: https://code.visualstudio.com/. Take this link and download the correct version according to your OS. Follow the instructions for installing it onto your computer.
